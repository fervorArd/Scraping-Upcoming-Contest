# Scraping-Upcoming-Contest
Scraping upcoming contest from hackerearth and automatically email the results.

A python program that scrapes the details of the upcoming challenges on hackerearth and send the email every week with the details like the registration link to the contest, challenge name and the timestamp of the challenge so I don't miss out any of the contest.

# Running the script

To run the script every week(or on any day of the month) you can schedule task with windows or linux to automatically excute the script in the background.

### For Windows
- Go to Windows- Start and Find the Task Schedular.
- Press "Create Basic Task".
- Enter task name and the description.
- At "Trigger" select daily(or weekly etc).
- Then specify the starting date and time.
- Action : Select start a program.
- Add the path to the script.
- Click Finish.

Also you can automate a python script to run daily using [pythonanywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fQjA8w1woQ)
